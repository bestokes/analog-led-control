# Introduction

A simple web page with buttons to manage an LED strip. 

This is quick and dirty, it could be extended/improved. I wrote it with cgi/bash because I wanted to do something quickly. 

Requirements

This tutorial will get you up and running with a RGB LED strip: http://popoklopsi.github.io/RaspberryPi-LedStrip/#/ 

** Then: **

* install apache2 webserver and enable cgi
* put the cgi script into your cgi-bin
* put the index.html into your DocumentRoot
* download jquery into /js/ in your DocumentRoot
* the buttons came from here http://unicorn-ui.com/buttons/builder/ - put the buttons.css into /css/ in DocumentRoot
